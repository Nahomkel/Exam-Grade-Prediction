### What the Project Does

This project provides a toolkit for classification and analysis tasks using machine learning models. It includes code snippets for logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models. The logistic regression part focuses on binary classification, while the SVM part demonstrates both linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernel models.

### Why the Project is Useful

The toolkit is useful for users interested in understanding and implementing basic classification models. It demonstrates the application of logistic regression for binary classification and SVM for more complex scenarios, along with visualization techniques such as ROC curves and confusion matrices. The project serves as a learning resource and can be a starting point for more advanced analysis tasks.
